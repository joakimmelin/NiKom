Now it's time to set file keys for the file you just uploaded. To
display a list of alla available keys type '?'. You can enter a key
by typing the beginning of it followed by return. To see what keys
you have already set type '!'. If you have set a key by mistake and
want to unset it you simply type the name of the key again and press
return.
Try setting as many appropriate keys as possible to make it easier
for other users to find the files they are looking for.

WHen you are done setting keys you press return on an empty line.
